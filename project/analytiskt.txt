vi har givet:
I' = U/L
U' = -I/C

derivera första, byt ut mot andra, skriv om:
I'' = U'/L
I'' = (-I/C)/L
I'' = (-L/C) * I = f(t, I) (eller f(t, I, I') I guess, men I' = 0 eller nåt sånt)

because I'm dumb it took me way too long to figure this out:
what we have is that the second derivative is negative whenever the function value is positive, and vice versa
so in other words, the function curve starts to bend downwards whenever the value is positive and vice versa
so it's going to be periodic, which is what we want.
amazing.

So let's put some numbers in I guess?

I'' = -1400000 * I;

right, so if I is something with sin, you derive it once, you get cos, 
you derive it again, you get -sin, which is sort of what we want.

ok, so it's...

I = sin(sqrt(L/C)*t)

because that gives us:
I' = sqrt(L/C) * cos(sqrt(L/C) * t)
I'' = L/C * -sin(sqrt(L/C) * t)
